# Warranty / End of Life Support

## Summary
The project's goal is to grab warranty, end of life, and support contract dates 
for devices inside a ServiceNow instance. So far, it will only grab this 
information for Cisco and Dell devices, however, in the future we plan on 
supporting other manufacturers. The data grabbed is then displayed in a custom
ServiceNow dashboard which is able to give a user an insight on their customer's
warranty and end of life statuses for all their devices.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why
The information that is pushed into ServiceNow is vital to helping the user
get an idea for the status of their device's support. A user is able to make
a more informed decision on how many devices need new warranties. They are also
able to detect if a device is obsolete using their end of life date. This is
valuable for customers to know so they can buy new devices that are supported
to keep their environments free of out-of-date hardware.
